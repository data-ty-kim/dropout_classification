Dropout Classification for Graduate School Students
==========

## Overview
Welcome to the repository dedicated to the classification of dropout graduate students at K University. Leveraging the XGBoost algorithm, this project aims to predict and understand the factors contributing to student dropout.

## Project Details
### Methodology
The classification process involved data handling, data analysis, and model development, undertaken between February 2023 and July 2023. Leveraging the XGBoost algorithm, I carefully engineered features and optimized parameters to achieve superior performance.

### Performance Metrics
The model achieved impressive performance metrics, with an accuracy of 0.9692, precision of 0.8615, recall of 0.6512, F1-score of 0.7417, and an AUC of 0.9515. These metrics underscore the effectiveness of the developed solution in identifying potential dropout cases accurately.

### Publication
This work is documented in a scholarly paper published in the Journal of Korean Association for Educational Information and Media in 2024 (Vol 30, No 2, pp. 595-617). This study underscores the necessity and method for developing a system to predict graduate student dropout, advocating for the acquisition and utilization of additional data for further research.

### Conclusion
This repository stands as a testament to the dedication and expertise invested in understanding and addressing dropout rates among graduate students. It serves as a valuable resource for educators, policymakers, and researchers interested in addressing this critical issue in academia.
